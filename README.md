# Advent of code 2020 solutions

Test driven (but not hardcore TDD) solutions to Advent of code 2020 in Clojure. To run the tests, I'm using the [VS Code Calva extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva) with the [Test on save](https://calva.io/test-runner/) setting set. You'll get the test results right in your namespace file.
